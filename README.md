# VEXTRINEP
> **Strict Geometric Composition Engine**
VEXTRINEP is an experimental image generation system based on the "Tangram Tiling" paradigm and an original policy of strict shape validation. This project represents a fusion of mathematical rigor with minimalist aesthetics, where every form is the result of uncompromising calculations, not chance.

## 🧬 Etymology and Philosophy
The name **VEXTRINEP** is not accidental. It is a precise record of the DNA of a unique graphic style, constituting a verbal representation of the creative process in which raw geometry meets mathematical perfection.
### **VEX** – Foundation and Form
* **Vertex (Vertex):** Symbolizes construction points from which every creation begins. It is a tribute to the minimalist approach, where a limited number of points defines the ideal shape.
* **Convexity (Convexity):** Refers to the iron rule of form. The style rejects all depressions and concavities. Every element is full, stable, and "convex" outward.
### **TRI** – Structure and Discipline
* **Triangle (Triangle):** Indicates the simplest, yet most perfect geometric figure, which is the heart of the system.
* **Strict (Rigor):** The VEXTRINEP style does not accept chaos. Figures cannot intersect or overlap randomly. Beauty here arises from imposed limitations and ideal order.
### **NEP** – Essence and Precision
* **Non-flatness (Spatiality):** Signals that every, even the smallest figure, has significance. The system rejects mediocrity and flat forms – every element must occupy concrete space.
* **Epsilon (Invisible Measure):** A guarantee that elements are matched to each other with atomic accuracy. It is a promise of perfect contact, where there is no room for rounding errors.

## ⚙️ System Axioms
The VEXTRINEP engine operates on a set of inviolable principles (Core Logic):
1. **Closed Topology:** All figures must form a closed circuit.
2. **Zero Gap / Tangram Tiling:** Figures can perfectly share edges, but never violate their interiors.
3. **Strict Convexity:** The system accepts only convex figures (triangles, quadrilaterals). Concavities are rejected at the pre-validation stage.
4. **Anti-BigBrother Protocol:** Protection against completely covering another figure and elimination of all forms of partial covering or overlapping of objects (overlapping).
5. **Epsilon Precision:** All collisions and contacts are calculated with an error tolerance of `EPSILON = 0.00001`.
## 📦 Status
The system functions as a closed geometric validation logic.
